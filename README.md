## Recommended Development Order

For the most efficient development path, consider this order:
1. Set up infrastructure (Next.js, Docker, DB, R2)
2. Implement core data models and API
3. Build authentication system
4. Develop scheduling system and platform integrations
5. Create frontend UI components
6. Implement analytics and monitoring
7. Test and deploy
